        //1.	What is a Delegate in C#? 

        //Ans-  It is a referance to another methods 
        //      This is same as abstraction (Hidding of data for confidentionality)
        //      This is use for more Security
        //      Syntax is - ( <Access specifier> + Deligate + <Return Type> + <Name> (<Parameters>))



        //2.	Why do we need delegates in C#?

        //Ans-  For Maintaining Confidentionality
        //      So no one can modify the atual method


        //3.	What are the benefits of delegates?

        //Ans-  Data will be secure
        //      This will archive abstraction as the method will be hidden
        //      Multiple or singular Methods can be passed by referance of Delegate


        //4.	What are types of delegates in C#?

        //Ans-  Simple Deligate - Only single Method can be called.
        //      Multicast Deligate - More than one methods can be passed.
        //      Anonomous Deligate - Here instead of Parameters code or code block is passed.


        //5.	How to define a delegates in C#? and write a syntax/definition for delegates

        //Ans-  1_Create a method in a specific class
        //      2_Create a Deligate in Global area as per Syntax (by Entering suitable - Name ,Parameters.)
        //      3_Create instance of class where the method is defined and declare the Deligate in instance Construtor or while creating variable initiate deligate and call method.
        //      It is a referance to another methods 
        //      This is same as abstraction (Hidding of data for confidentionality)
        //      This is use for more Security
        //      Syntax is - ( <Access specifier> + Deligate + <Return Type> + <Name> (<Parameters>))  


        //6.	What is a Singlecast delegate in C#? and write a program for singlecast delegate

        //Ans-  Simple Deligate - Only single Method can be called.
        //      For code Please refer to utilities class


        //7.	What is a Multicast delegate in C#? and write a program for muliticast delegates

        //Ans   Multicast Deligate - More than one methods can be passed.
        //      For code Please refer to utilities class.


        //8.	What are Anonymous Delegates in C#? and write a program for anonymous delegates

        //Ans    Anonomous Deligate - Here instead of Parameters code or code block is passed.
        //      For code Please refer to utilities class.


        //9.	How to Use Events and Delegates in C#? and write a sample program using events

        //Ans   


        //10.	What is reflection? and write a program to use reflection.

        //Ans   It is use to obtain all type information in runtime
        //      This gives all info of any assembley
        //      Refer utilities for this code.
